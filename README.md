#listserialports

Used for listing and checking serial device availability. On typical use case,
program needs serial port and before opening serial port check that port is not in use by other programs

This is golang library, check lsserials as example command line tool.


This library is only part of my other project.

Later, there will be some features found from setserial utility (if my project requires)
https://github.com/brgl/busybox/blob/master/miscutils/setserial.c
like checking real uart status
